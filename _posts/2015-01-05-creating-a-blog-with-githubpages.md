title: Creating a Blog using GitHub/Jerkyll
---

Yay! My blog is up.  I wanted to Jerkyll-powered site but looking a couple of websites, Ruby was involved.  Well, since I am now using Python and learning Django, Python Web Framework. I really did not want to spend time learning Ruby ways to develop this blog locally and was looking for the easiest way to create my blog

Thanks to my Google skills ("keywords are important"), I as able to find a good guide [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). The author [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/)

The option used was fork  repository.   Changing settings and config file and just like there, my blog is up.  The guide provides step by step details on what changes are needed.  

Side Note: It took more than 30 minutes for my page to be published or maybe it was my impatience lol
