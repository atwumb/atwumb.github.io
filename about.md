My name is Amy. I’m an developer. I have been in IT for while but never truly programmed. I’m on this journey because it is challenge and fear that I wish to overcome. For the longest I felt, I couldn’t be a programmer. I’m determined to prove myself wrong.

Python is my chosen language that I’m taking this coding journey. I hope to document my trials and successes in my quest to gain proficiency in Python and venture into web development.
