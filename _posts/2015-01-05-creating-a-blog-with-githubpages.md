title: Creating a Blog using GitHub/Jerkyll
---

Yay! My blog is up.  I wanted to Jerkyll-powered site but looking a couple of websites, Ruby was involved.  Well, since I am now using Python and learning Django, Python WebFramework, I really did not want to spend time learning Ruby ways to develop this blog locally.  

Thanks to my Google skills ("keywords are important"), I as able to find a good guide [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). The author [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/)

Side Note: It took more than 30 minutes for my page to be published or maybe it was my impatience lol
